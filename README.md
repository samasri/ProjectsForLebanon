# Description
The development of this web application started in October 2015. It is intended for an NGO with the mission to improve volunteering and community service experience throughout Lebanon. The websiteâ€™s goal is connecting volunteers to NGOs via a Facebook-like interface. Due to university course load and other responsibilities, I resigned from working on it in February 2016.

# Technical Description
This project is implemented using Java servlets. The servlets interact with a MySQL server in order to provide their functionality. More detailed technical description and known bugs are found in the [documentation file](https://github.com/samasri/ProjectsForLebanon/blob/master/Documentation.pdf).

# Directory Description
* **Database:** Contains the database schema and the SQL queries to create and populate the database.
* **Src:** Contains the source code of the Java servlets
* **WebContent:** Contains some supporting scripts and documents for the pages to be viewed correctly; such as images and javascript and css codes.
