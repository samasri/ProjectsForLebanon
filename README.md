# Description
The development of this web application started in October 2015. It is intended for an NGO with the mission to improve volunteering and community service experience throughout Lebanon. The websiteâ€™s goal is connecting volunteers to NGOs via a Facebook-like interface. Due to university course load and other responsibilities, I resigned from working on it in February 2016.
